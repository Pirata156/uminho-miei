# Assessments Resolutions

This folder contains a collection of resolved assessments from practical tests in Functional Programming (FP) classes, spanning multiple school years.
These solutions demonstrate problem-solving approaches and implementation techniques in Haskell learned throught the school year.
Note that some exercises may be repeated across different years.
The full exercise descriptions have been included as comments within each implementation file, making it easy to reference the original problems alongside their solutions.

- **Version or Date:** 2010-2016
- **Authors:** PIRATA ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Pirata156))
- **Language:** Haskell

### How to Start This Project

To work with these assessments, follow the steps in one of these options:

1. **Load a Assessment into GHCi:**
   - Open GHCi (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler interactive environment).
   - Use the `:load` command (or `:l`) followed by the filename to load a `.hs` file. For example: `:load fp0809_tests_questions.hs`.

2. **Compile and Run a Assessment:**
   - Use the `ghc` command to compile a `.hs` file: `ghc -o Pract0809 fp0809_tests_questions.hs`.
   - Run the compiled program: `./Pract0809`.

3. **Import the Worksheet Module:**
   - In GHCi, you can import the module of a `.hs` file by using the `:module` command followed by the module name.
   - In another file, you can import the module of a `.hs` file by using the `import` tag in a `.hs` file.
   - Note: The filename and module name must match for this to work.

## Practice


#### [Practical Test Questions - 2008/2009](fp0809_tests_questions.hs)

This file contains a comprehensive collection of almost 50 exercises focusing on fundamental Haskell programming concepts.
The exercises cover a wide range of topics including list manipulation, recursion, higher-order functions, type definitions, and tree operations.
Each exercise is thoroughly documented with comments explaining the problem statement and includes complete solutions.
The exercises progress from basic list operations to more complex data structures like binary trees and custom types.


#### [Practical Test Questions - 2015/2016](fp1516_tests_questions.hs)

This file contains solutions for 50 exercises focused on recursive implementations of common Haskell prelude functions.
The exercises cover fundamental list operations, list manipulation, and multiset operations.
Each exercise is thoroughly documented with comments explaining the problem statement and includes complete solutions.
The exercises progress from basic list functions like enumeration and concatenation to more complex operations involving multisets and ordered lists.


#### [Test - 2009/2010](fp0910_test.hs)

This file presents solutions to a comprehensive 2-hour Haskell assessment, structured in two distinct parts.
Each exercise documented with the original problem statements and detailed solution implementations.
