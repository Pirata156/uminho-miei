This is the project README file for Worksheet 01 (Ficha Pratica 01).
Here, you'll find information about the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practical exercises.

PROJECT TITLE: Worksheet 01 (Ficha Practica 01)
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) classes' practical exercises for beginners.
VERSION or DATE: 27/02/2012
AUTHORS: PIRATA (https://github.com/Pirata156)
JAVA VERSION: Java 7

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
  1. Open the project in BlueJ.
  2. Compile each Java class.
  3. Compile Javadoc for documentation.
  4. Use BlueJ tools for testing.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

**Exercise Overview:**

This BlueJ project consists of Java classes, each corresponding to an exercise from Worksheet 01 of the Object-Oriented Programming course.
Each class is named Exercise01, Exercise02, and so forth, and contains a main method for execution.

- **Exercise01**: Read a name and age, then print a text with the results.
- **Exercise02**: Read 10 integers and determine the largest integer entered.
- **Exercise03**: Read N reals and give the results of their exponent powers, also entered by the user.
- **Exercise04**: Read a sequence of positive integers and determine the difference between the largest and smallest integers read.
- **Exercise05**: Calculate the factorial of an integer value, given as an argument to the main() method.
- **Exercise06**: Determine system date and time, perform a cycle, and calculate the total milliseconds for the cycle.
- **Exercise07**: Calculate the difference in days, hours, minutes, and seconds between two dates.
- **Exercise08**: Accept N ratings and determine their average.
- **Exercise09**: Accept N integer temperatures, determine the average, and find the day with the greatest temperature variation.
- **Exercise10**: Read the radius of a circle and calculate area and perimeter.
- **Exercise11**: Read a sequence of real numbers and calculate sum and product.
- **Exercise12**: Print all odd numbers less than N.
- **Exercise13**: Display a vertical menu with options and read user choice, repeating until the user selects Exit.
- **Exercise14**: Generate a random number and let the user guess it in 5 attempts.
- **Exercise15**: Read a person's birthdate and calculate their current age.

Feel free to explore each Exercise class, read the Javadoc documentation, and use this project as a reference for your OOP exercises.

**Notes:**
Ensure that Javadoc documentation is generated for a detailed explanation of each class and its methods.

**Author's Notes:**
Feel free to reach out to the author (PIRATA) on GitHub for any clarifications or assistance.

**Exercises complete description:**

Ex 1: Read a name and age and print a text with the results.

Ex 2: Read 10 integers and determine the largest integer entered.

Ex 3: With N given by the user, read N reals and give the results of their exponent powers Exp, also entered by the user.

Ex 4: Read a sequence of positive integers (terminated by the value -1) and determine the difference between the largest and smallest integers read.
Print this value, as well as the largest and smallest.

Ex 5: Write a program that calculates the factorial of an integer value, given as an argument to the main() method through the arguments of this method.

Ex 6: Write a program that determines the system date and time, performs a cycle with 10 million unit increments of a given variable, determines the time after such a cycle, and calculates the total milliseconds that such a cycle took to execute.

Ex 7: Write a program that uses an auxiliary method that accepts two dates and determines their difference in days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The result of the method must be a string.

Ex 8: Write a program that accepts N ratings (real numbers) between 0 and 20 and determines their average (use printf() for the results).

Ex 9: Write a program accepting N integer temperatures (at least two) and determine the average of the temperatures, the day (2,3, ...) on which the greatest variation in absolute value was recorded in relation to the previous day and what the value effective (positive or negative) of this variation.
The results must be presented in the form:
The average of the N temperatures was ____ degrees.
The greatest temperature variation was recorded between days __ and __ and was ___ degrees.
The temperature between day __ and day __ increased/decreased ___ degrees.

Ex 10: Write a program that reads the (real) radius of a circle successively and calculates the respective area and perimeter with great precision (5 decimals).
Use printf() for the results. The program should only end with a reading of radius = 0.0

Ex 11: Write a program that reads a non-empty sequence of real numbers ending in 0.0 and calculates its sum (∑) and its product (∏) with precision of 4 decimal places in the result.

Ex 12: Writing a program read an integer N and print all odd numbers less than N.

Ex 13: Write a program that presents the user with a vertical menu with the options:
1.- Insert 2.- Remove 3.- Consult 4.- Save 5.- Exit
Then, the program must read an int, which will only be valid if between 1 and 5, and must present the user, verbatim, with the chosen option (Insert, Remove, etc.) or the message “Invalid Option!”. The program should repeat the menu presentation until the user selects option 5.- Exit.

Ex 14: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The program will give the user 5 attempts to guess the generated number.
With each user attempt, the program will indicate whether the number generated is greater or less than the number given by the user.
On the third failed attempt, the user loses. Whether you lose or win, the program must ask the user whether he wants to continue playing or not.
If yes, a new number will be generated and the game will resume.

Ex 15: Write a program that reads the year, month and day of a person's birth and calculates their current age, telling the user the date of birth read, today's day and the age that was calculated.
